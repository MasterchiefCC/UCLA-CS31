a. I didn't encounter any problem and obstacles when I worte down the program.
Just a little confusion: 
From the version of vs2013 and above I can't use the function scanf unless I turn off the SDL.
However, there still would be a warning after I used the scanf.
But I can successfully compile my code in G++ without any warning and error.

b.
check for the error();
check for the error(International Hotel Waikiki,-1);
check for the error(International Hotel Waikiki,48,);
Example(International Hotel Waikiki,48,USA);
Example(International Golf Club Dubai,55,UAE);

For the special case which the revenue below 20(A,1,Turkey);
For the special case which the revenue above 20 but below 50(A,21,Turkey);
