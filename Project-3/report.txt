Function isValidUppercaseStateCode;
gaven by the website;

Function hasCorrectSyntax;
input a string;
a loop

return 0;

stop loop;
if one of next three postions are not letters or the fourth postion is not a digit; 
return 0;
next round;

a loop
if a letter apper and the postion of that letter is not in the end of the string
input to a string and using the function isValidUppercaseStaeCode to check;

if is put it into result;
